## What is Snyk?

Snyk is a platform allowing you to scan, prioritize, and fix security vulnerabilities in your code, open source dependencies, container images, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations.

## Snyk’s developer-first approach

Developers now assemble applications with a combination of proprietary and open-source code, run that code in containers, and then deploy with infrastructure as code configurations with technologies like Kubernetes and Terraform.

A good security process secures each of these components where they are built and maintained. Snyk integrates into DevOps processes to work with developers using the methods each prefers, while following and supporting industry best practices. Snyk integrates directly into your IDEs, workflows, and automation pipelines to add security expertise to your toolkit.
